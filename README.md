#File Explorer

File Explorer is based on [SimpleExplorer](https://github.com/DF1E/SimpleExplorer) 

File Explorer functions as a normal file explorer, as well as Root Explorer (Root Required Obviously)

#Why Should You Use File-Explorer?

+ It is based on awesome [SimpleExplorer](https://github.com/DF1E/SimpleExplorer) by [DF1E](https://github.com/DF1E) 
+ Root Explorer
+ Awesome Features
+ Open Source (Free Forever? Maybe, Depends on development)
+ User Flexibility
+ Material Design
+ Highly Responsive


#Soooo, If this is based on SimpleExplorer, What makes it different from that?

See, Although I agree that the design is based on SimpleExplorer, and with full credits [to the maker](https://github.com/DF1E),
The app has many more improvements for smoother functioning and better root access through updated libraries. More features and improvements are planned for the coming days, weeks, months and years until everyone is fully satisfied. Although, Some features may be buggy, and cause crashes. 

If you do face crashes, in any form, Please report an Issue.
